# False Alarm Party Game

## Overview
A real-time multiplayer party game where players shout phrases and listen for others' phrases to tap on their screens. Best played with 3+ people in the same room.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PORT CONFIGURATION
**The frontend MUST be on port 5000 for Replit webview to work properly!**
- Frontend: Port 5000 (exposed externally via .replit [[ports]])
- Backend: Port 3001 (internal only, accessed via proxy)
- Never forward port 3001 externally - it should only be accessible through the proxy

### How to Update Port Configuration in .replit
The workflow configuration tools automatically update the [[ports]] section in .replit:
1. Remove existing workflows: `workflows_remove_run_config_tool`
2. Add Frontend workflow with `output_type: "webview"` and `wait_for_port: 5000`
3. Add Backend workflow with `output_type: "console"` and `wait_for_port: 3001`
4. The workflow tool automatically updates the [[ports]] section based on the webview workflow port

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 (‚úÖ **MODERNIZED**)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- **Testing**: Comprehensive automated test suite (53/53 tests passing)
- **Current State**: Fully modernized with React 18 and comprehensive test coverage

## User Preferences
- Prefers gradual, safe updates with testing ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED**
- Wants to use Replit best practices ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Plans to add QR code feature for easy lobby joining (next phase)
- Wants automated test suite before major updates ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- New to Replit, appreciates guidance on best practices ‚úÖ **PROVIDED**

## Recent Changes (2025-09-21)
### üéØ **DEVELOPMENT PROXY ARCHITECTURE PERFECTED**
- ‚úÖ **Socket.io proxy issue resolved** - implemented package.json proxy for seamless GET/POST handling
- ‚úÖ **Clean development setup** - no manual code changes needed between dev/production environments  
- ‚úÖ **Create React App integration** - uses built-in proxy instead of setupProxy.js for reliability
- ‚úÖ **Real-time connections validated** - backend logs show active Socket.io player connections
- ‚úÖ **Port configuration optimized** - Frontend (5000) + Backend (3001) with automatic proxy forwarding

### Technical Solution
- **Package.json proxy**: `"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"` handles all Socket.io traffic automatically
- **Host binding**: Backend uses 127.0.0.1 in development to prevent unwanted port forwarding
- **Workflow integration**: Clean 2-process development with webview on port 5000
