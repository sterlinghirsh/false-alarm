# False Alarm Party Game

## Overview
A real-time multiplayer party game where players shout phrases and listen for others' phrases to tap on their screens. Best played with 3+ people in the same room.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PORT CONFIGURATION
**The frontend MUST be on port 5000 for Replit webview to work properly!**
- Frontend: Port 5000 (exposed externally via .replit [[ports]])
- Backend: Port 3001 (internal only, accessed via proxy)
- Never forward port 3001 externally - it should only be accessible through the proxy

### How to Update Port Configuration in .replit
Since the .replit file cannot be edited directly by the agent, there are two approaches:
1. **For workflows**: Use workflow configuration tools (this is what the agent can do)
   - Remove existing workflows: `workflows_remove_run_config_tool`
   - Add Frontend workflow with `output_type: "webview"` and `wait_for_port: 5000`
   - Add Backend workflow with `output_type: "console"` and `wait_for_port: 3001`
2. **For [[ports]] section**: Must be manually edited by the user
   - The workflow tools do NOT automatically update the [[ports]] section
   - User must manually ensure [[ports]] has: `localPort = 5000, externalPort = 80`
   - Remove any port 3001 forwarding entries
